LIFU is a lower frequency than conventional ultrasound (such as used for scanning babies), which allows the ultrasound beam to penetrate to deeper tissues. It has a pulsed and continuous setting allowing for both a thermal and non-thermal effect. The ultrasound beam is focused which allows for more targeted treatment of deep tissue areas aswell as allowing effective treatment of joint pathologies such as osteoarthritis.
