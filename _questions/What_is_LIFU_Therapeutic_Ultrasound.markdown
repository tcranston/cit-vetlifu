Low Intesity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) is a new generation of therapeutic ultrasound. Therapeutic ultrasound has been recognized as an effective treatment for soft tissue injuries for many years. Its benefits are to increase blood flow to tissue thus speeding up the healing process, decrease pain by reducing swelling and to gently massage the area relieving tension and softening scar tissue.
