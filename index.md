## What is Therapeutic Ultrasound?
Therapeutic ultrasound has been recognized as an effective treatment for soft tissue injuries for many years. Its benefits are to increase blood flow to tissue thus speeding up the healing process, decrease pain by reducing swelling and to gently massage the area relieving tension and softening scar tissue.

## How does Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound differ from conventional ultrasound?
Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) is a lower frequency than conventional ultrasound, which allows the ultrasound beam to penetrate to deeper tissues. It has a pulsed and continuous setting allowing for both a thermal and non-thermal effect. The ultrasound beam is focused which allows for more targeted treatment of deep tissue areas and also effective treatment of joint pathologies such as osteoarthritis.
